# Sentence-Segmentation-in-Urdu

## Urdu Sentence Segmentation

This project aims to implement and practice basic text processing techniques in NLP for the Urdu language. The Urdu language poses challenges in sentence segmentation due to its different writing style compared to English, including the Space Insertion Problem and Space Omission Problem.

### Objective

The objective is to develop a technique for Urdu Sentence Segmentation and evaluate its performance. The assignment is designed to be completed from scratch, allowing the use of basic libraries if preferred, but existing libraries like urduhack (https://urduhack.com/) are not recommended due to their subpar performance.

### Dataset

A trial Urdu corpus, urdu-corpus.txt, is provided for this assignment. Alternatively, you can download the dataset from the following source:
[Parallel Corpus for English-Urdu Language](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zainuddin123/parallel-corpus-for-english-urdu-language)

### Implementation Challenges

Several challenges need to be addressed while implementing the sentence segmentation technique:

1. **Pattern Detection**: Determine how to detect patterns from the Urdu text that can help identify sentence boundaries.

2. **End-word Identification**: Find a way to identify the end-words of a sentence in Urdu.

### Evaluation

A function should be implemented to evaluate the performance of the segmentation technique. This requires applying problem-solving skills to assess the accuracy of the segmentation output.

Feel free to modify and improve upon the existing libraries or techniques to achieve better results.
